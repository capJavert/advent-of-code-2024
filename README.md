# Advent of Code 2024

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!

### Update #2: The first fifth of AoC is done! Most of the days "solved themselves," but there's just a lot happening in real life, so I've been spending late hours playing with the puzzles. The story this year is really interesting and each day references a place from one of the previous AoC, ahhhhh... memories... 🥰

### Update #3: Today was fun, first path finding challenge for this year. Issue was the puzzle was written backwards so I did not realized that I am not supposed to count distinct paths but just the specific paths. Imagine my suprise when part 2 was asking for distinct paths... so just cmd+z and it worked. Mush be the fasted part 2 I've ever done. 😂

### Update #4: Friday 13th was yesterday, solving this puzzle a bit late due to some errands I had to run in the city, traffic was terrable, probably due to 13th.. Actually we prepared a pretty cool PS5 dual sense controller for my friend's birthday. I hope he likes it. 😊 Last two days I solved partially (only part 1), and today was a nice throwback to math classes with linear equations, solved both parts in the end!

### Update #5: This year has a few spicy part 2 puzzles, and my time is limited, did solve every part 1 though and I'll try to see if I can back track at some point (probably not 😀)

### Update #6: Writing this after solving day 19, made basicpattern matching logic but needed some inspiration from reddit (it's late, already 20th of December 🙈). Tomorrow some family is coming and then doing a long run on 21th so let's see how I can catch up.. hoping this weekend puzzles are nice! Also Superman trailer got published today 🦸🐕

### Update #7: Long run went great, ran the full 95 kilometers (60 miles). Missed day 21 though, tried to write it but no motivation really, just chilling today. Solved day 22 part 1, looks like this year is just about skipping part 2's. 😅

### Update #8: Solved today's part 1 with ChatGPT, left part 2 for GitHub Copilot.. its still running... let's leave it and see if it spits out the answer while we shovel some snow outside. 🌨️😂
