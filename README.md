# Advent of Code 2024

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!

### Update #2: The first fifth of AoC is done! Most of the days "solved themselves," but there's just a lot happening in real life, so I've been spending late hours playing with the puzzles. The story this year is really interesting and each day references a place from one of the previous AoC, ahhhhh... memories... ðŸ¥°

### Update #3: Today was fun, first path finding challenge for this year. Issue was the puzzle was written backwards so I did not realized that I am not supposed to count distinct paths but just the specific paths. Imagine my suprise when part 2 was asking for distinct paths... so just cmd+z and it worked. Mush be the fasted part 2 I've ever done. ðŸ˜‚

### Update #4: Friday 13th was yesterday, solving this puzzle a bit late due to some errands I had to run in the city, traffic was terrable, probably due to 13th.. Actually we prepared a pretty cool PS5 dual sense controller for my friend's birthday. I hope he likes it. ðŸ˜Š Last two days I solved partially (only part 1), and today was a nice throwback to math classes with linear equations, solved both parts in the end!

### Update #5: This year has a few spicy part 2 puzzles, and my time is limited, did solve every part 1 though and I'll try to see if I can back track at some point (probably not ðŸ˜€)
