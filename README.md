# Advent of Code 2024

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!

### Update #2: The first fifth of AoC is done! Most of the days "solved themselves," but there's just a lot happening in real life, so I've been spending late hours playing with the puzzles. The story this year is really interesting and each day references a place from one of the previous AoC, ahhhhh... memories... ðŸ¥°
