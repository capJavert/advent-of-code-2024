# Advent of Code 2024

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again... So let's go!!

### Update #2: The first fifth of AoC is done! Most of the days "solved themselves," but there's just a lot happening in real life, so I've been spending late hours playing with the puzzles. The story this year is really interesting and each day references a place from one of the previous AoC, ahhhhh... memories... ðŸ¥°

### Update #3: Today was fun, first path finding challenge for this year. Issue was the puzzle was written backwards so I did not realized that I am not supposed to count distinct paths but just the specific paths. Imagine my suprise when part 2 was asking for distinct paths... so just cmd+z and it worked. Mush be the fasted part 2 I've ever done. ðŸ˜‚
